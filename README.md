# Problem Solving [In progress]
Programing questions solution in swift

## [Tries](https://github.com/osama10/Problem-Solving-In-Swift/tree/main/Tries)
- Can be use to find prefixs. Some applications are autocomplete search, spell checker etc
- One variation is suffix tree. Best for pattern matching ( most optimized )
    - Substring check,
    - All occurences of substring 
    - Finding all distinct substring

## DP
A technique to solve optimization problem in breaking down in to overlapping sub problems and finding the solution using those problems. Optimization problems can be of enumerations ( climbing stairs ), max min profit ( stock selling ) or yes or no

A problem is DP if 
   - it has overlapping sub problems ( sub problems computed more than once )
   - optimal sub structure ( solving any problem by solving slving sub problems optimally)
   
Some improtant algorithm are
    - Stair case to heaven
